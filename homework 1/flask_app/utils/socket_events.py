socket_events.py — handles real-time chat messages using WebSockets.

WEBSOCKETS vs. HTTP:
  When you visit /resume, your browser makes one HTTP request and gets one
  HTML response — then the connection closes. That's how most web pages work.

  WebSockets are different: the connection stays open, like a phone call.
  Both sides (browser and server) can send messages at any time without
  making a new request. This is why the chat feels instant.

HOW EVENTS WORK:
  Instead of URL routes, WebSockets use named events:
    - Browser emits 'send_message'  →  server handles it here
    - Server emits 'receive_message' →  browser displays the reply

  The @socketio.on(...) decorator works just like @app.route(...) in Flask,
  but for WebSocket events instead of HTTP requests.
